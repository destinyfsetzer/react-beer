# React Beer Library
This is my first React project outside of a React tutorial.


## Resources

- https://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html


## Production URL
Production Site - https://react-beer-library.herokuapp.com/


## Built With
- [Brewery DB](https://www.brewerydb.com/) - a database for beer information
- [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/) - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - a resource for icons
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.
